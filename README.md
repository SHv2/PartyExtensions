# PartyExtensions
This mod extends play stats that are saved to the local leaderboard when playing in Party mode. Adds trackers for pure left and right hand accuracy, score and accuracy before and after modifiers, and more.

# How To Use
- Unzip PartyExtensions.zip in your Beat Saber directory
- Play a map in Party mode and click on the purple heart-cube ðŸ’Ÿ icon next to the score
- Existing scores on the base game Party leaderboard will be without extended data until they are played over

# Scores and Saved Data
- Scores are saved in `/UserData/PartyExtensions`
- Existing scores will not contain
- **Pressing the Trashcan button in Party Mode deletes ALL score data**
- PartyExtensions backs up your scores at the launch of each game. If you accidentally delete all your scores, you can retrieve them from the `.bak` files in `/UserData/PartyExtensions/`
- **To restore, you MUST retrieve the .bak files before the next time you launch the game.** Save copies of the `.bak` files to another directory just in case, and rename the files in `/UserData/PartyExtensions/` to without the `.bak` ending.
- **If the scores are important to you, please make your own backups.** The mod's feature mitigates user error and is not meant for actual backups!
- **Note:** If you uninstall PartyExtensions and play maps in Party Mode, then reinstall PartyExtensions at a later time, the display may become out of sync. The files can be repaired manually if you are knowledgeable but they must not contain any mistakes. This is not advised.
