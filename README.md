# PartyExtensions
This mod extends play stats that are saved to the local leaderboard when playing in Party mode. Adds trackers for pure left and right hand accuracy, score and accuracy before and after modifiers, and more.

# How To Use
- Unzip PartyExtensions.zip in your Beat Saber directory
- Play a map in Party mode and click on the purple heart-cube icon next to the score
- Scores are saved in `/UserData/PartyExtensions`
- **Pressing the Trashcan button in Party Mode deletes ALL scores.**
- PartyExtensions backs up your scores at the launch of each game. If you accidentally delete all your scores, you can retrieve them from the `.bak` files in `/UserData/PartyExtensions/`. **You MUST retrieve the backup files before the next time you launch the game.**
- If your scores are important to you, please make your own backups. The mod's feature mitigates user error and is not meant for actual backups!
