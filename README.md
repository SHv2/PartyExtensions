# PartyExtensions
This mod extends play stats that are saved to the local leaderboard when playing in Party Mode. Adds trackers for pure left and right hand accuracy, score and accuracy before and after modifiers, and more.

# How To Use
- Unzip PartyExtensions.zip in your Beat Saber directory
- Play a map in Party Mode and click on the purple heart-cube ðŸ’Ÿ icon on the leaderboard to see detailed stats
- Existing scores on base game party leaderboard will be without extended data until they are played over
- Optional: To generate the first backup of your existing base game party scores, set at least 1 score with PartyExtensions, then quit and restart game.

# Scores and Saved Data
- Scores are saved in `/UserData/PartyExtensions`
- **Pressing the Trashcan button on leaderboard will delete ALL party score data** (this is base game behavior)
- PartyExtensions backs up your scores at the launch of each game. If you accidentally delete all your scores, you can retrieve them from the `.bak` files in `/UserData/PartyExtensions/`
- **To restore, you MUST retrieve the `.bak` files BEFORE the next time you launch the game.** Save copies of the `.bak` files to another directory just in case. Rename the files in `/UserData/PartyExtensions/` to without the `.bak` ending. Do the same with the base game files `LocalLeaderboards.dat.bak`, `LocalDailyLeaderboard.dat.bak` and put them in your `AppData` folder.
- **If the scores are important to you, please make your own backups. Don't forget base game AppData.** The mod's feature mitigates user error and is not meant as for actual backups!
- **Note:** If you uninstall PartyExtensions and play maps in Party Mode, then reinstall PartyExtensions at a later time, the data may become desynced. Knowledgeable users might be able to repair the files manually. This is exceedingly difficult and not advised. If you must uninstall PartyExtensions, back up the data first so you can restore, else delete your PartyExtensions data when you install it again.
